A Sokoban game; push box onto spot. Simple!

Rules:
    - Cover all spots with boxes of matching colour
    - Gray matches any colour
    - Higher levels = (possibly) more boxes and controllable avatars
    - Multiple avatars are controlled simultaneously; you cannot control them individually

Challenge yourself and win in as few moves as possible! But, most importantly, just enjoy yourself, because who's counting? (Hint: The Game...)
